## AppCenter

Flatpak support for AppCenter was improved.

It now lists the apps that need to be updated and shows their download size.

Also, the Flathub source is no longer automatically added to the system installation.
It's up to the user to install it, or the distro to automatically configure it.

## Fluid

Fluid documentation is now deployed with GitHub Pages, hence it's now available [here][docs].

## Flatpak

We now build the Flatpak nightly repository with GitHub Actions workflows.
